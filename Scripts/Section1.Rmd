\section{The language of probability}

Like the English language, the language of probability has its own nouns, verbs, and adjectives.  Confusing these parts of speech will result in "category errors."

***Random variable***:  **A random variable is a variable that takes on a random value when given the sample space.

***Sample space***: A sample space contains all the possible outcomes that could happen.

***Event***: An event is a certain outcome occuring before the outcome has occurred.

***Probability***: **Probability will always be a value between 0 and 1 that expresses how likely an event will occur out of all possible events in the sample space.**



We can simplify a lot of the basics of probability into different sets.
